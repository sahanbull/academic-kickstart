  Based on an article URL provided by the user we get the text, title, keywords and entities from the Alchemy API. We use the musiXmatch lyrics dataset of the million song dataset (http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/challenge) to generate a list of topic cluster of the available songs. Using the Alchemy information we then classify the article to one of this topics and retrieve the nearest songs. In addition we use the article entities to retrieve top songs directly from music APIs. Those combined results are then surfaced on the front end.
