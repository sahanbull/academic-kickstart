Sahan is affiliated to the UCL Centre for Artificial Intelligence currently contributing to the [X5GON project](www.x5gon.org). His research interests lie on the theme: "Improving Recommendations of Educational Contents to Lifelong Learners". Before joining UCL, he worked  in several research roles in the industry in cybersecurity and personalised advertising domains where he gained experience in user state modelling in a big data landscape. His current research is motivated towards developing scalable, automatic quality assurance models for educational resources and modelling the knowledge state of lifelong learners to identify the most helpful educational resources that will enable them to achieve their learning goals.
